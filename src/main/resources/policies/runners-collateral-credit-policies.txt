1. Purpose and Objectives

Purpose: The primary purpose of this credit policy is to mitigate credit risk through stringent collateral requirements.
Objective: To ensure all credit extended is backed by adequate security, minimizing potential losses in cases of default.
2. Scope

This policy applies to all credit transactions that require collateral as a condition for credit approval across the entire organization.

Documentation: Proper legal documentation of the lien or claim on the collateral must be completed before credit disbursement.
Monitoring and Revaluation: Collateral values must be monitored and periodically revaluated to ensure they cover the outstanding credit balance. Revaluations should be conducted annually or more frequently if market conditions warrant.
6. Terms of Sale

Standard Terms: Terms such as payment schedules and interest rates will be adjusted based on the collateral's risk assessment.
Non-Compliance: In cases of non-compliance with the terms, the company reserves the right to enforce the collateral claim to recover the outstanding amount.
